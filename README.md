## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- React - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- Bootstrap - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- node.js / Express / Node - for the backend
- Css - for Style

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
on GitHub.
